# GoldenAgeofGaming
Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are increasingly more incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?  In this project, I explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. This is achieved by comparing gaming sales data with critic and user reviews data. In doing so, we can discover whether video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.  Each table is limited to 400 rows for this experiment, but the complete dataset with over 13,000 games can be found on Kaggle.
